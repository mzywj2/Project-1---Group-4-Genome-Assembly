# Genome Assembly using Illumina and Nanopore data

## This project utilises both long-read (nanopore) data and short-read (illumina) data to conduct genome assembly. The pipeline conists of the quality control tool NanoPlot to assess the Nanopore reads. Also, the use of Minimap2 and Miniasm to align and assemble the reads, as well as the use of Bandage to visualise the assembled genome.
